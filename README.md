- 👋 Heyla and well met! I’m @TheKeeper81
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming and making games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Pixel Game Maker MV.
- 💞️ I’m not actively looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, as I'm still learning the PGMMV software. This said, if you've got a game idea for making a game with PGMMV, and you really think I can contribute, shoot me a message!
- 📫 How to reach me... I can be reached via my primary email address: TheKeeper81@gmail.com
